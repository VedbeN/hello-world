Ok, Hi Humanity!

This is the message that, as I understood is for describing what was made before this commit. Thus, I'm going to write below the message that means a lot for me. I'm finally have a big goal in my life and here it is:

I'm planning to be good and even awesome at coding and I hope one day soon it will happen!
If you help me, I say you thank you! Hope my laziness won't argue with me about having fun with programming!

And, I f**** love tacos! %)
